<p>With a title like <i>Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy, 1453 to the Present</i> this book was only ever going to appeal to those who already know they are interested in the topic. Like me! Aside from the title that makes you dread the question â€˜so what are you reading these days,'' it was actually a pretty decent read.</p>
<p>As you might infer from the cover, the book chronicles the history of Europe since the end of the Middle Ages up until 2011, covering the rise and fall of the major players and all their various petty feuds.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of them.</p>
<p>One of the main impressions you get of European history from this book is that it reads very much like the story of twenty five-year-olds put in a playpen, constantly fighting over the same old stuff, to no real consequence (until recently anyway). Scarcely a decade goes by without some war or other breaking out.</p>
<p>A few over-arching narratives are apparent. Viewed over five hundred years, the state of Russia often looks like a tide at times, that periodically and cyclicly floods into Eastern Europe, then recedes, then returns, then recedes again. I read this during (what is hopefully) the height of the Russia-Ukraine standoff, which put the whole thing in a new light. Russia''s borders receded further than they had for a long time in the 1990s, and we may now be seeing the tide rising again. Or not. Another running theme is the similarly periodical threat of Islam to the South, from the armies at the gates of Vienna to the 2004 bombings of Madrid, there''s always been an uneasy relationship between the two civilisations.</p>
<p>Few books can be called faultless however. The author seems keen to stress his personal theory that Germany is central to everything, and I mean <em>everything</em> that happened in world history. Most of the time he is convincing, but other times it feels like a bit of a stretch. I could go and look for examples but honestly I can''t be bothered. Go read it and see what you think.</p>
