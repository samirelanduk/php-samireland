Fourth Year

<p>Got back from London on Tuesday, after my flight on Monday was cancelled because of a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-29111954">bomb scare</a> in the airport. It was a great week - got to see London, some friends, and experience the thrill of a cancelled flight. Hope the next trip down South won''t be as long in coming as the last one was.</p>
<p>I''ve spent the week since then doing a bit of iGEM (really want to just wrap this up now but there''s a lot still to do) and getting ready for the final year at university, which starts tomorrow. I feel strangely calm about all this, even considering I need to average 75% in Fourth year to get a First.</p>
<p>The Scottish Independence referendum will be held on Thursday too, another thing which I will be glad to see over. The polls are very very close at the moment, making the dperessing prospect of independence somehwat more likely.</p>
<p>Anyway, we shall know this time next week.</p>
