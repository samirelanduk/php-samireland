Keyboard

<p>Exciting times today, as my new logitech iPad keyboard arrived. I can tell it''s going to have a huge effect already - it''s made the iPad into essentially a laptop. I uploaded this entry directly as FTP from it! That and Microsoft Office on it mean that I probably won''t have to replace my dying laptop with another laptop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tomorrow is the last official day of the iGEM competition. We''re all going down to London on Sunday for a big meetup of all UK teams at UCL. Presentation practice time!</p>
