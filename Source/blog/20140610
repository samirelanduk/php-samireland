SULSA Conference

<p>A fortnight or so since the iGEM competition really started for our team, and we''ve been attending the SULSA Synthetic Biology conference today and yesterday. It was my first Scientific conference, so I was particularly curious to see how it all proceeded.</p>
<p>It''s been a good couple of days - got to meet three other Scottish iGEM teams, and got a feel for presenting our ideas.</p>
<p>(Well, I didn''t personally, but that''s my own fault for being away for the entire week when the presentation was being put together I guess.)</p>
<p>Work on the project itself begins tomorrow.</p>
