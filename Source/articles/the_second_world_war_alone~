<p>This was the second instalment of Winston Churchill''s history of the Second World War and, as the title suggests, covers the period of roughly May 1940 to December 1941 when the United Kingdom and its empire fought the war largely alone.</p>
<p>Every one of the wonderful attributes of the first instalment is present here to – Churchill''s brilliant narrative style, the fascinating insights into the life of the man at the top, the narration by Christian Rodska which captures the author''s style perfectly. There isn''t a great deal to add to that review to be quite honest.</p>
<p>The period this volume covers is quite interesting - <i>Alone</i> suits it well. It covers the surrender of France, and the ensuing freeze in Anglo-French relations that culminates in the Royal Navy destroying the French Mediterranean fleet to prevent it falling into German hands. The Soviet Union is also frequently alluded to as a slightly menacing, outrageously self-serving ‘neutral.'' Churchill was no great fan of the U.S.S.R. and it shows.</p>
<p>On to the next one...</p>
