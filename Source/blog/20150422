Digital Ocean

<p>samireland.com has moved, and now lives on my very own Virtual Private Server from the great guys over at Digital Ocean. The site will be exactly the same (so don''t worry Brazilian bots who use my site) but it does mean I should be able to start building Python web apps and other exciting things soon.</p>
<p>Nearly finished my dissertation - in three weeks the battle will have been fought and (hopefully) won, which feels extremely weird. Been a student of some flavour or other for twenty years and soon I get to finally graduate.</p>
<p>Luckily Edinburgh has transitioned straight from freezing cold Winter to Summer without bothering to go through the awkward Spring stage, and it''s been really sunny here for a few weeks now. I''ll miss you Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Now everybody say happy birthday to Neville. He was one on Monday.</p>
