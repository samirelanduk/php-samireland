New Site Design

<p>I grew quite bored of the old design for the site, and so I have crafted a new one. I am quite pleased with the result, though of course incremental changes will continue to be made. Mobile CSS is last on the list, so it might be about a week before I get around to making it optimised for your puny mobile screens (though it doesn''t look <em>terrible</em> at the moment).</p>
<p>In lesser news, there are about three weeks until I get to go to Boston, which is very exciting. It does mean that the next three weeks are going to be pathalogically busy though. I''m trying to put together the ''<a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:Edinburgh">wiki</a>'' for this, with another team member, which is time consuming but also rather fun. There''s also a presentation to put together now, and <em>still</em> lab work which we sorely need to get done. Home stretch.</p>
<p>I have also arranged my Honours project - the final year project that all Biology students do in their final year, and which is worth a third of the final degree score. In the first day of this semester we were all told a scary story that might as well have been called ''the boy who talked too much about his Honours project and almost got sued into bankruptcy by the university for wrecking a commercial project in doing so,'' so I probably won''t talk about it in too much detail on here. Suffice to say, that it''s a computational project which is going to look at the quantum mechanics of drug-protein interactions. If it turns out to be one fifth as awesome as it sounds, I''ll be very happy indeed.</p>
