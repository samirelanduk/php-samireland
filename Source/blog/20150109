2015

<p>It''s 2015. The world has turned.</p>
<p>I''m back in Edinburgh, getting geared up for the disseration that will make up most of semester eight of eight, which starts on Monday. Once that''s over, I have to do... something else I guess. Really should work out what that will be.</p>
<p>Happy new year.</p>
