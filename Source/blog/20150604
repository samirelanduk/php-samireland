First Class

<p>The University of Edinburgh has seen fit to award me a First Class degree, so today I''m pretty happy. Four years has flown by, but at least I''ve finished it with a pretty decent score!</p>
<p>Not much else to report - I''ve started publishing my projects, and I have another soon to be released, but today is for celebration. Lots of time now!</p>
