July end

<p>Nearly August now. Five weeks left until the iGEM project ends, seven until the final year of my degree begins, twenty-two until the year ends. As far as the project goes, progress is picking up, but things won''t come together until the end now.</p>
<p>I''m trying to plan a trip to London at the end of the summer break, but planning it around five different people''s schedules is proving to be ''really difficult'' as the French say. At the minute it''s probably going to be 3rd-8th September.</p>
<p>Since I have no relevant photos for this post, here''s another picture of Neville. It has nothing to do with the post, but it''s either that or the agarose gel I ran today in the lab.</p>
