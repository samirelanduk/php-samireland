<p>I don''t normally read career help books (I don''t have one after all) or self-help books (which I suppose this is), but this one came with high recommendations, so I gave it a go.</p>
<p>The book''s message is that the best way to get a fulfilling job and career - "work you love" - is to ignore the usual advice to ''follow your passion'' and instead focus on acquiring valuable skills, wherever you work. Newport argues that A) most people don''t have pre-defined passions anyway and B) you need valuable skills to get great jobs, because such jobs are rare and require something rare in return.</p>
<p>That''s the essence of it. There are other useful concepts along the way, such as the ''craftsman mindset'' and the rather more interesting concept of ''deliberate practice,'' but the heart of the book is captured nicely by the title.</p>
<p>There isn''t a lot to say about the book really. I found it interesting, persuasive and useful - not <em>enjoyable</em> as such but then it''s a self-help book. It''s there to teach not to entertain. The examples he provides are useful, if numerous, and the book is nice and concise.</p>
<p>If you happen to be worrying about career choices, it''s worth a look.</p>
