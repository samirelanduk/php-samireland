<p>This book covers (briefly) the evolution of the human species from the time of our divergence with the chimpanzees seven million years ago until the modern age of Hiroshima and Apollo 11. Along the way it tracks the important evolutionary changes that make humans so unique - our acquisition of language, of monogamy, of art, menopause and agriculture. It also looks at our more destructive characteristics - drug abuse, xenophobia and our tendency to exterminate species on an appalling scale within a very short time of reaching a new area.</p>
<p>At times the book felt a bit disjointed, with one chapter jumping to a completely different topic from the prior one, and it is only on reaching the conclusion and looking back at the book as a whole piece that the various threads come together. They do however, in grand fashion, and the book''s message rings loud and clear by the closing pages - our own nature will destroy us if we do not make real efforts to understand it and accept it. Diamond makes a very convincing case for this, backed up by both academic evidence and his own fascinating experiences as a fieldworker in New Guinea.</p>
<p>Some chapters are stronger than others - the chapter on drug addiction and its evolutionary causes did not seem to me to be very convincing - but by and large the book is both engaging and persuasive.</p>
<p>Though Diamond ends on a potentially optimistic note, arguing that...</p>
<blockquote>We are the only ones creating our problems, so it is completely within our power to solve them.</blockquote>
<p>...I am not sure that the content of his book really supports this view. It is hard not to feel pessimistic after reading of the scale of species extinction that is still accelerating, or the fates of previous resource-starved societies in the past. But perhaps books that conclude with messages of hopelessness and woe don''t make it past publishers.</p>
