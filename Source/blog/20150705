Graduation Week

<p>I officially graduated from the University of Edinburgh on Monday - I am now Sam Ireland, B.Sc. (Hons.). I won''t be updating my website''s domain name.</p>
<p>Still pretty busy, to say I''m unemployed and no longer studying. Currently learning Java as quickly as I can, and hoping to use it to extend my somewhat complete ''<a href="/election/">Alternative Election</a>'' project which recently went live.</p>
<p>Ideally this all needs to be done before Saturday, when I will (with no small degree of sadness) be leaving Edinburgh - possibly temporarily, possibly not. Edinburgh has been my home for four years now, and while it did take some time for me to warm to it, there is now nowhere else I would rather be.</p>
