<p>This book begins mid-way through 1991, and narrates the last few months of the Soviet Union: the August coup against Gorbachev, the nationalist forces which pulled the union apart into its constituent republics – and the actions and reactions of President George H. W. Bush and the United States.</p>
<p>It opens with the context of modern Russia – its designs in Ukraine and the current bout of bad feeling between Russia and the West. This is done to form the backdrop of the entire story – that of countering the narrative that the United States ''defeated'' its Cold War foe and triumphantly brought about its destruction. Plokhy makes the case that the United States wanted to keep the Soviet Union intact as a stable partner, and prevent its disintegration into nuclear armed warring states.</p>
<p>The relations of the republics in 1991 – relatively united in their desire to escape Soviet control (including Russia) – is vital in understanding their relationship in the 2010s, and this account pores over the relationship in great – at times, excessive – detail.</p>
<p>The main drawback to this book is that it starts too late. You get the impression that at the start of the narrative, many of the key events have already taken place. The Gorbachev reforms, the Fall of the Berlin Wall, the withdrawal from Eastern Europe, the reunification of Germany, and the breakaway of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have already taken place when the story begins here, and what is left is a detailed account of how the Soviet Union dies from the thousand wounds it had already sustained.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is an invaluable perspective on modern relations with Russia.</p>
