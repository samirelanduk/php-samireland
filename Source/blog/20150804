PyChats

<p>Three weeks into my exile in Arnside. It has improved a little now that there''s an actual internet connection.</p>
<p>Still, I''ve been pretty busy. I''ve released my first Python library - <a href="/computing/pychats">PyChats</a> - into the wild. It''s now available for download via PyPI. I''m pretty pleased with it to be honest - it''s much sleeker than the original version, and even has the ability to simulate the speech of any given contact.</p>
<p>I also finished a Java project - <a href="http://election15.co.uk">election15.co.uk</a> - and am still working on my <i>Rome: Total War</i> Python library. Trying to take the opportunity of being unemployed to finish as many projects - and learn as many new skills - as I possibly can.</p>
<p>And, there''s always the walking. Arnside is good for that, at the very least.</p>
