London Presentation

<p>The team gave their presentation before the other UK iGEM teams today, and I was resposible for talking about the lab stuff. It was a practice run really, for the real deal in Boston. We learned a lot, I think. It went well anyway.</p>
<p>This is part of the two day ''SynBio 2.0'' conference attended by fourteen teams, and hosted by UCL - my university from another life. The other seven teams are presenting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there''s all of London to be seen. Feels very strange to be walking these streets again, but I''m here for a week so very much looking forward to seeing it all again.</p>
