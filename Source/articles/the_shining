<p>This was the first fiction book that I ‘read'' in audiobook form. I''d put off starting such a book for a long time because I was pretty sure it wouldn''t work, that following the plot would be too hard when the slightest drift of attention means you miss something crucial, and so I was loathe to commit to one. Luckily I was as wrong as I usually am.</p>
<p>The Shining is almost a classic by now, helped in no small part by the film that followed it, and it''s definitely one of Stephen King''s most popular. It follows the Torrance family – Jack the recovering alcoholic writer, his wife Wendy, and their five year old son Danny who has all kindsa psychic weirdness about him. They move to the Overlook Hotel, which Jack has been entrusted to look after over the Winter, when the snowstorms make it totally inaccessible to the outside world. To cut a fifteen hour story short, there''s a whole bunch of malevolent spirits which hound the family, fuelled by Danny''s ‘Shining'' which makes him especially perceptive to them, and Jack slowly starts to lose his mind.</p>
<p>I don''t usually read horror stories, but I did enjoy this one. Maybe it''s because I knew more or less what was going to happen through sheer pop-cultural osmosis, but I didn''t find it massively scary – the events of Room 217 being the obvious exception. Once it got past its slow start though, it becomes much more engrossing, and I found myself ploughing through the last nine hours in three days, despite the first six hours having taken almost a month to listen to.</p>
<p>There are only four characters of any real importance – the three Torrance family members and the excellent Mr. Halloran, whose desperate rescue journey is one of the best parts of the final act.</p>
<p>I was going to watch the film, but since reading that Stephen King considers it a pretty poor adaptation, I''ve gone off the idea. His main problem with it, apparently, is that the film shows Jack has being inherently insane before they even got to the hotel, unlike the book, in which he''s just a normal guy, struggling with alcoholism, upon whom a genuinely malevolent hotel acts on and breaks. I much prefer the latter, but I guess that''s hard to portray in a film.</p>
