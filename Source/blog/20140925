Referendum and hills

<p>It has been a most eventful week.</p>
<p>The first week back at university was very busy, forcing me to deprive the good citizens of the internet of any posts on here. There were lectures to get used to again and try and learn, a looming project selection deadline which we reminded of regularly, a careers talk to add more stress into the mix, a meeting for <em>The Student</em> almost every day, an iGEM progress meeting, and of course the continuing iGEM labwork itself. Until iGEM and <em>The Student</em> wrap up at the end of October, it’s probably going to be like this for a while.</p>
<p>And the referendum happened! Thursday was quite tense, but took a surreal turn when a friend from school got in touch. She lives in Vietnam now, works for a Vietnamese TV company, and wanted someone living in Scotland to do a telephone interview on the referendum… Sure why not! So, after getting the actual voting out of the way, I went home and got ready for that. A guy called me at six, told me the questions he was going to ask me (‘How do I think the vote will go?’, ‘How has the referendum affected people’s daily lives?’, ‘Do I think this will set a precedent for Wales and Northern Ireland?’) and then gave me ten minutes to think up answers. And then we went ahead, I gave an interview on Vietnamese TV (not live thankfully). I guess that makes me famous.</p>
<p>That night I took a spur of the moment trip up the Holyrood, the Scottish parliament. It seemed silly to waste the fact that I lived in Edinburgh. The nationalists were out in force, chanting <em>No more London rule!</em> and, perhaps in a bid to give the historic parliament more dignity, a verse of <em>You can shove your Union Jack up your arse!</em> There were unionists out too, not chanting – a few people were wearing the union flag draped over them, and one particularly brave/stupid man was wearing the English flag.</p>

<p>I stayed awake to listen to the first few results come in. The 32 councils of Scotland were declaring their results when they were ready, and the <em>No</em>s were soon coming in. I awoke again at five o’ clock, by which time it was clear the vote was going to be ‘No.’ As indeed it was, 55% to 45%.</p>
<p>The good news didn’t end there though. I soon became a superstar in Vietnam as my interview aired – I’m expecting a call from their top people any day now about hosting my own show. I’ll try and put the video below. I have to admit I haven’t actually watched it yet, but I’m told I’m dubbed over to the point where thankfully my voice isn’t heard much. It''s around the twelve minute mark.</p>

<p>And then to add to all that, my new computer arrived! It was an excellent day.</p>
<p>The weekend passed uneventfully. I was working at the hotel for much of it. I was finally convinced to download <em>Minecraft</em> - it is very good, but probably not for my degree.</p>
<p>Which almost brings us up to date. This week I’ve been at Firbrush, a ‘recreation centre’ in the highlands, by Loch Tay. I went walking in the hills which was nice, though as I didn’t find the old fort marked on the map that I was looking for (despite literally <em>crawling</em> under bushes at one point), part of me does wish I’d gone kayaking instead. The trip was part of my Fourth Year programme, to get to know everyone else on said programme. Nae bad, as the locals say!</p>
<p>So yes – long week, long post.</p>
