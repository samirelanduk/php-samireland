<p>This is a very thorough examination of the structural problems in the pharmaceutical industry today. If this does not sound like an especially exciting or interesting subject, then you might be forgiven. However Goldacre proves well up to the task of presenting it in a way that engages you and constantly reminds you of what is at stake - real people with real suffering and pain who really die, because of things being done by these companies.</p>
<p>The book covers the industry''s habit of <a href="http://www.alltrials.net/">not publishing drug trials</a> that are unfavourable to them, of embarrassing problems with regulators like the EMA, of dangerous advertising practices, and more. It is littered with intelligent suggestions by Goldacre - a doctor himself - for how we (as a society and individually) can try to make changes.</p>
<p>If I had a criticism I guess it would be the length. At times it feels like the author repeats himself, and I suspect the message could have been made in fewer pages (or hours of audio in my case), but this isn''t necessarily a bad thing. He makes a point of providing examples and academic papers for most if not all of his assertions, and if some of the more crucial points are repeated in different parts of the book - well, there are worse crimes.</p>
<p>I particularly liked a feature of this audiobook version at the end, where the narrator (one of the best I''ve heard - Jot Davies) does a short interview with Ben Goldacre himself, on his motivations for writing the book and some reactions to it. It''s stuff like that give audiobooks like this a slight edge over the actual book version I think.</p>
<p>Anyway - it took a while to get through, but I recommend this one wholeheartedly.</p>
<p id="time">Read (audiobook) - June/July 2014</p>
