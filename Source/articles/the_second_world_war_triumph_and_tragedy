<p>Part four of four of Churchill''a account of his greatest achievement – leading the United Kingdom through the Second World War and on to final victory.</p>
 
<p>Except it isn''t written as a particularly happy story, and arguably this isn''t really even a book about the end of the Second World War. It is much more a book about the start of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The beginning picks up where part three ended, and details the invasion of Italy, the overthrow of Mussolini, the landings in Normandy and the defeat of the German army in France. I was slightly surprised at how briefly they are covered – I had expected the D-Day landings at least to cover several chapters (especially since an entire chapter was devoted to the battle of Crete in part two) but the narrative covers them relatively quickly.</p>
<p>This is probably because Churchill was keen to get to what is arguably the core message of this book, and maybe even the whole four part history – that the Soviet Union is untrustworthy, dangerous, and maybe an evil as great as Hitler''s Germany. The books were written around 1950, and hardly in a vacuum – communism was triumphant everywhere at this time, and Churchill was ringing the alarm bells as hard as he could.</p>
<p>It''s a theme that''s run all the way through the series. Even when the Soviet Union was a key ally, Churchill frequently reminds the reader of their time as a quasi-ally of Germany, of how they were content to see the Western democracies destroyed, of their ingratitude, and of their insensible demands for implausible Second Fronts. But here, it steps up. The disasters in Poland are covered heavily – Stalin''s role in the failed Warsaw Uprising, his crushing of democracy there, the establishment of the Communist Party as the single party. Greece too, gets more attention that it probably warrants were the book solely dedicated to a history of the War. Here was Britain''s greatest success in forestalling the communists, and Churchill all but says ‘I told you so'' as he was loudly criticised for intervening at the time.</p>
<p>And always he returns to his other core message – that the only way to save the world is for the United Kingdom and the United States to work together for their common values, for the “English speaking world” to unite against communism.</p>
<p>Other interesting events covered are the death of his close friend Roosevelt (and his frustrations at being unable to get as close to President Truman afterward), his shock at losing the election of June 1945, the development of the atom bomb, and his thoughts on events after the war as far as 1957.</p>
<p>The whole series has been by far the best thing I''ve ‘read'' as an audiobook – Churchill is a genuinely great writer (and even if he weren''t, the unique perspective he offers would make up for it) and the narrator, Christian Rodska, is superb at conveying Churchill''s mannerisms.</p>
<p>I think it''s time I gave History a rest for a while – everything I read seems to be either about the War or some other part of History. This will remain my favourite account of the War, probably for a long time to come.</p>
