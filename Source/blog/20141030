Boston

<p>I am in Boston.</p>
<p>We (the iGEM team) arrived yesterday afternoon. I''ve been pretty much spending all the time since marvelling at the fact that I''m in <em>America</em>.
<p>Hasn''t been that much time for tourism though - the big presentation is tomorrow. Having spent the whole Summer working on the project, tomorrow we have to sell it in one twenty minute presentation. We had the practice run today at the Hynes Conference Centre (and got a really cool badge) and it looks we''ll be OK - there''s still work that needs to be done, but not a huge amount.</p>
<p>Still though. America!</p>
