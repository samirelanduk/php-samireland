<p>This one took a while - mostly because the reading of it just so happened to coincide with a particularly busy few months, and also because it''s a very... expansive subject.</p>
<p>Stephen Pinker sets out to explain how the mind works. No big deal. It''s only the most complex object in the known universe. He doesn''t do a bad job of it though either. He covers many different aspects of human cognition - visualisation, emotions, music, spirituality, rational thought, altruism, and even more general (and arguably, more interesting) topics such as the nature of intelligence, the mechanics of using physical matter to make intelligent decisions, and the difficulties in getting the idea of the mind as an evolved organ (or sets of organs) accepted in a academic field dominated by social science dogmas.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting area by far is Pinker''s take on consciousness. He makes a distinction in an early chapter that so few would-be explainers pf consciousness do, between three distinct phenomenon that people can mean when they refer to consciousness - knowledge available to the executive mind, the ability of a mind to have a concept of itself, and ''phenomenal awareness''. It is this latter that is the most interesting, but without fail whenever someone claims to have explained consciousness, they are in actual fact referring to one of the first two. Pinker makes no such misstep, and in his closing paragraph, offers the suspicion that we do not even have the kinds of mind that are capable of understanding consciousness, any more than beetles have the kind of minds that are capable of understanding semi-conductor Physics. This is the most convincing ''last word'' on consciousness that I have heard anyway.</p>
<p>I went into this book already a fan of Pinker - his <i>The Better Angels of our Nature</i> is probably my favourite Non-Fiction book of all time. So I may be biased when I say that this was one of the best Science-related books I have read in some time. But I most definitely encourage you to find out for yourself.</p>
