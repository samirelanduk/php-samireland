July Rush

<p>Tomorrow marks the start of week 5 of the iGEM project, and the time remaining is starting to feel a bit less... season length. I think we''re making good progress (though there was a setback on Friday), but once July starts the pressure will start to get really pronounced.</p>
<p>Probably won''t get a chance to update this until the following week (though let''s face it, if you''re reading this you''re either me, or from the distant future, so I''ll save my apologies) - this is because I''m trying to get version two of my <a href="http:\\nurigraphs.net">other website</a> functional before July starts. This is my nutrient calculator website which currently needs a new name, and which hopefully someday will be open for other people to use.</p>
<p>Lots of threads coming together at the moment.</p>
