<p><i>How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
That has such people in''t.</i></p>
<p>I thought it would be nice to read one of the ''classics'' for a change, instead of history books or awful fantasy books. So I read <i>Brave New World</i>.</p>
<p>The problem with writing a review of a book that came out in the 1930s and which is widely hailed as one of the greats, is that there''s nothing new to say about it. It''s been discussed and dissected by people much more qualified to do so than me endlessly, and there''s nothing of import I can really add. I mean, obviously that''s true of everything I put on here, but I''m especially aware of it here.</p>
<p>The first I noticed was how spoiler-happy the introduction<strong>s</strong> are. First of all, there were too many. I know it''s had a lot of editions, but come on! It doesn''t <em>need</em> two introductions, a retrospective by Huxley himself, a page all in French musing on utopias, <em>and</em> a foreword. Those things take up fully 16% of the book. Put them at the end! That would solve the spoiler problem too - what''s wrong with these people? Before I decided to skip them all, I read all about the Savage, the Ford-worship, the society - everything. Piss off! I haven''t read the book yet! I at first assumed that the book was marketed toward students who were assigned the book and didn''t want to read the whole thing, but now that I''ve read it, I can''t imagine it''s used in schools much...</p>
<p>Anyway, once I did start the book, I quite enjoyed it. I can see why everyone always goes on about how ahead of its time it is - it''s not just the developments he (usually) correctly anticipates, the whole style just feels much more modern than the 30s.</p>
<p>The world he creates is usually counted as a dystopia, a dystopia in utopia''s clothes, which only John the Savage can see through. To my mind though it seemed more like a utopia in dystopia''s clothes. I read the description of the embryo manufacture plant thinking that actually, this was a fantastic system. Maybe that''s just me.</p>
<p>(Speaking of John by the way - I''m glad he''s a Shakespeare fan, and it''s not at all unrealistic that a copy of the Complete Works would survive centuries in a tribal enclosure where no one reads, but it did get a bit tiring when he started speaking entirely in Shakespeare quotes. They can''t understand you John.)</p>
<p>As I''ve already said, there''s not much more to add to the last eighty years of reviews, so I won''t go on and on. Suffice to say it was as thought-provoking as advertised, and makes for an excellent read if you want something short and want to be able to say "I''ve read <i>Brave New World</i> you know."</p>
