<p>Part three of four, this time covering the period from the failed German drive to Moscow, to the expulsion of the Axis from Africa: 1940 - 1943.</p>
<p>The alliance with the United State s is in the forefront throughout, even before Pearl Harbour. Churchill was a great believer in the power of Anglo-American cooperation, using the word "destiny" a few times. He is especially warm in his accounts of his interactions with President Roosevelt, whom he was genuinely fond of and clearly regarded as a real friend, above and beyond politcs. Roosevelt seems to have reciprocated this feeling.</p>
<p>I again got the feeling, as I had started to in volume two, that I would be quite happy to read a book that was simply Churchill describing the various voyages he has taken. There are numerous trans-atlantic flights described here, and they''re almost the best bits - stories of dodging German fighters, coming back the wrong way and accidentally flying over the Channel (and apparently causing a RAF fighter to be scrambled against them). Other memorable anecdotes include:</p>
<ul><li>Churchill sends a message back home while sailing to the US that he finds <i>Hornblower</i> (a book he had been recommended) "admirable." This apparently caused a slight panic in the Middle East headquarters when they read the message, as they thought ''Hornblower'' might be some codeword for an operation which they hadn''t been told of.</li>
<li>He also muses on a theory of the time which said that the reason the Japanese were so inclined to abandon attacks if circumstances changed was due to the "cumbersome and imprecise nature" of their language, which supposedly made it difficult for commanders on the spot to improvise. No idea if this is still a modern belief.</li></ul>
<p>One of the more moving and memorable parts was Churchill''s account of his relief after Pearl Harbour, and the sudden prospect of victory:</p>
<blockquote>So we had won after all. Yes, after Dunkirk, after the fall of France, after the horrible episode of Oran, after the threat of invasion (when apart from the air and the navy we were almost an unarmed people) after the deadly struggle of the U-boat war (the first battle of the Atlantic gained by a hand''s breadth), after seventeen months of lonely fighting and nineteen months of my responsibility in dire stress. We had won the war. England would live. Britain would live! The commonwealth of nations and the empire would live! How long the war would last or in what fashion it would end, no man could tell, nor did I at this moment care. Once again, in our long island history we should emerge, however mauled or mutilated, safe and victorious. We should not be wiped out, our history would not come to an end. We might not even have to die as individuals. Hitler''s fate was sealed. Mussolini''s fate was sealed. As for the Japanese, they would be ground to powder. All the rest was merely the proper application of overwhelming force.</blockquote>
<p>The feeling of relief when a situation, while not noticeably improving, suddenly has its terrible worse-case scenario removed, is pretty relatable I think. It''s strange to think that the previous day, defeat and destruction before the Axis was a realistic possibility, and then a day later victory became more or less certain. If you ignore the fact that he was expressing joy at an attack upon an ally (understandable in context) and the unfortunate literal fulfilment of his prediction about Japan''s defeat - this is a passage which really opens Churchill up to the reader in its frank expression of relief.
