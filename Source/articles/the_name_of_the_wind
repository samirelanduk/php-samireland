<p>I gave up on this one.</p>
<p>I ended up with <em>The Name of the Wind</em> when I realised that I never really read fiction any more, and when I do it''s either because I already know I''ll like the story (as in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>) or because it''s heavily recommended (like the admittedly excellent <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>). I wondered if maybe I was missing out on some great books with such narrow criteria. So I told Facebook I would read the first piece of fiction that was commented, and in came <em>The Name of the Wind</em> two minutes later.</p>
<p>Now, before I get into the specifics of this book, it has to be said that I am <em>very</em> susceptible to reviews. All it takes is one negative comment about a work of fiction and then it''s all I can see, and so I always try to avoid reviews and such until after the film/book/tv show is over. In this case though, I had a friend who had <em>also</em> read the book and was, it turned out, not a fan at all.</p>
<p>This may have made it hard to warm to the book, but it also had some benefits.</p>
<p>Anyway, the book. It''s a fantasy book, set in a fictional world. You already know everything you need to about this world from the ''fantasy'' description - that''s not a criticism, there''s just not much more to say about it. The author likes the idea of world-building though. They don''t have weeks they have ''spans,'' and their currency is some complex thing which I''ve already forgotten. This is not world-building at its best, it''s just the author changing the name of everything to make things harder to remember. ''Oh Kvothe has a copper jot - is that more or less than the talent that was mentioned earlier? Let me just flick back a hundred pages and work it out.'' That <em>is</em> a critisicm.</p>
<p>Kvothe, by the way, is the main character. He is introduced at the start as a barkeep with a Mysterious Past, and once a travelling scribe comes across him and begs for his life story, the novel settles into its main format - Kvothe''s life story, as told by Kvothe.</p>
<p>Kvothe is a talented guy. Good at everything without really trying, becomes skilled at magic without really trying as a teenager, joins a university with no money by being obnoxious in his interview and yet still getting everyone to like him for no real reason, and just generally comes across as very unreal.</p>
<p>It might not be fair of me to criticise the overarching story since I stopped 46% of the way through and never saw it come to fruition, but I can''t say I found it very interesting. Oh your parents were murdered and you want to find the demon worshiping cult that did it? Good luck I guess.</p>
<p>That''s probably the essence of why reading this was a trial - I realised that I fundamentally didn''t care about any of the characters or what happened to them, or indeed who many of them were. And I decided that life was too short, that there''s a finite number of books you can read in a lifetime, and that you shouldn''t waste time on a book which you gave a fair go but which clearly isn''t for you.</p>
<p>I know the book has a lot of fans, so I should stress that many of my issues with the book were just differences in taste - Fantasy has never really been my thing - though parts of it are just objectively bad.</p>
<p>Anyway, long review. Negative ones are always more fun to write (and possibly less fun to read) but there we go. I''ll probably do the old Facebook recommendation thing again, though possibly with a few more conditions.</p>
