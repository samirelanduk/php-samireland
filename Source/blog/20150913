New Job

<p>I am back in Edinburgh. As of tomorrow I will be a Research Fellow at the Centre for Integrative Physiology, working on their enormous drug/receptor <a href="http://www.guidetopharmacology.org">database</a>. Very exciting times. The project will last a year, so my residence in Edinburgh (I'm now an employee of the University of Edinburgh) will now go on for at least a fifth year.</p>
<p>That's the only major piece of news at the moment. I'm still working on some side projects - including moving this website to a Django-based system rather than its current static form - and I'm also starting a Machine Learning course next week. I'm sure I can find a use for that.</p>
<p>All in all, things are going pretty well.</p>
