PhD

<p>From October of this year, I will officially (1) be a PhD student, and (2) be a Londoner again.</p>

<p>I went down to London at the start of the month to interview and, happily, was offered the place on the Structural, Computational and Chemical Biology programme – very happily in fact, as it was the only application I made! The programme is run jointly by UCL, Birkbeck and the Francis Crick Institute.</p>

<p>I have been a student at UCL before in a previous life, as a Medical Student from September 2009 to January 2010. That span of time should offer a clue as to how well that turned out, so it was some relief that the offer came in nonetheless. UCL will make me a Doctor yet.</p>

<p>The trip to London was a treat as always – saw some friends, saw some buildings, paid some quite extraordinary amounts of money on drinks. Better get used to that I suppose.</p>

<p>Otherwise, life in Edinburgh is the same as always. I will miss Edinburgh, but it is time to move on. And by ''move on'' I of course mean move to a city I have lived in before. Still – London!</p>
