Mid-Semester

<p>Almost halfway through the first semester. It''s been pretty quiet so far.</p>
<p>Mostly I''ve just been working on my Honours Project, a virtual screening thing, and it''s only recently started to pick up any real steam. Other than that things are much quieter and peaceable than they were last semester, which was outageously manic.</p>
<p>I''ve been in London again this weekend, seeing a friend over from Belgium. This was really great, and even made the ten hour round train journey worthwhile.</p>
<p>Next week I''ll be helping out in the assembly of the next iGEM team, the sandpit for which is happening Monday to Friday. I think I''m giving a short talk to the ''applicants'' on Tuesday, about the wonder that was our team and our project - lucky people. And then job applications will have to start, unless I want to be homeless and jobless come July.</p>
