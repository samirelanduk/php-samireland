Arthur''''s Seat

<p>Got a call from my flatmate at 7:45 this morning. She had woken up on Arthur''s Seat - a <em>mountain</em> (sort of) - with no memory of how she got there. She also had no shoes and needed me to bring her some.</p>
<p>So I did. That was the most interseting thing to happen all day, though it didn''t have much competition. Sun was stronger than it has any right to be in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>iGEM continues. We''ve gotten into the lab for the first time - very exciting.</p>
