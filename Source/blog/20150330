First Quarter

<p>March is coming to an end, and with it the first quarter of the year. The dissertation is passing its mid-point, job applications have begun, and the end of university is in sight.</p>
<p>It''s been six whole weeks since the last post, and with the exception of this past week, it''s been pretty good. Made a lot of progress with my side-projects, and the weather is finally starting to warm again. I even went to a wedding, which was another reminder of how old I am getting.</p>
<p>Starting to think seriously about where I want to live after university ends. I am very fond of Edinburgh, but the dream has always been to return to London someday â€“ and besides, things in Edinburgh are a-changing right now. Ultimately I''d be happy to live most anywhere for the right job I guess. Maybe by the next post I will know...</p>
