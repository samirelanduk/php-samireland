<p>I pretty much devoured this book. Usually audiobooks take quite a while to get through, partly because it''s just difficult sometimes to make yourself listen to it instead of, say, music - even if you enjoy listening once you have started. But this wasn''t just easy to listen to, it was difficult to stop listening to. For the first time ever, I completed an audiobook in a day.</p>
<p>Some of the credit, I guess, must go to the fact that autobiographies are easier to consume than other books - especially when the subject is someone you greatly admire, as I do David Mitchell. But mostly, it was a consequence of the fact that David Mitchell is a smart, funny person, whose intelligence and humour is in plentiful supply throughout the book.</p>
<p>Structured around a walk around London, he tells the relatively uneventful story of his childhood, upbringing, university days, and breakthrough into comedy. As a man with whom I somewhat identify, there are plenty of moments that make you grin like an idiot in the way only someone <em>exactly</em> describing a thought process that you yourself have had can do.</p>
<p>And some of it hit a bit close to home. Towards the end he describes his realisation that he had mismanaged his priorities in life, at Robert Webb''s wedding:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It''s always weird to see someone you''ve known for ages, a contemporary, get married. Or at least I always find it so. Throughout the time that I''d worked with Rob, there''d been something else going on his head. Something more important than performing, or his career, or even his friendships, for all that he valued those things very highly.</p>
<p>I realised, as I listened to his tearful speech about Abby, and her tearful one about him, that he''d remembered and prioritised the attitudes and feelings that all loved children experience before anything else.</p>
<p>Through all his ambition, failure and success, he''d kept a sense of perspective, while I had not. As Abby sat down, in floods of tears and to rapturous applause, I stood up to make some jokes.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Though it is, as people who know David Mitchell will know, a happy conclusion. I had somewhat been put off by the knowledge that the final chapter was about Victoria (his now wife, then fiancée), for no reason other than I often find it very jarring when comedians suddenly ‘go serious''. I needn''t have been - the chapter is genuinely lovely and moving, and not at all out of character.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what really makes the book is the fact that it is narrated by David Mitchell himself. It''s not always a good thing when an author narrates their own book, but in this case it adds so much to the book. If you do read it, be sure to get the audiobook version, and cancel any plans you might have for the next 24 hours.</p>
