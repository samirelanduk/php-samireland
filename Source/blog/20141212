Exams, Doom, Gloom

<p>It''s December. It''s cold. It''s exam time. Times are bleak.</p>
<p>It''s been ages since I wrote anything here because there''s been no time, and nothing has happened really. There was an essay to do. It was about sewage, wastewater treatment, and ''activated sludge.'' No one ever got excited about sludge, and I''m no exception.</p>
<p>And now there''s exams. There was one yesterday which could have gone better, one on Tuesday, one on Wednesday, and one on Friday. Then I get to go home to Blackpool but even then, unlike previous years I can''t recharge because I have to start on the <em>next</em> thing - the dissertation deadline in the middle of January. <em>Then</em> maybe I can have a week off.</p>
<p>All very complainy here in the dying days of 2014, but it could be worse. At least it snowed...</p>
