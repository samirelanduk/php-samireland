<p>This was a much better read than I had anticipated, and I say that having had high expectations to begin with.</p>
<p>The book is Churchill''s own account of the period leading up to his first term as prime minister, including the rise of Hitler, the problems of the British government, and his own activities during this time - both in political exile and during the first months of the war.</p>
<p>The first thing that becomes apparent is that Churchill was a genuinely great writer and story teller. He has a real, identifiable style, of a kind that is no longer seen any more.</p>
<p>Since the book is entirely from Churchill''s perspective, it is obviously a little one-sided, unapologetically  so, but is mostly convincing. He refrains from excessive ''I told you so''s that he might have indulged in, and tries to remain fair in his criticism of the inter-war British and French inter-war governments. Nevertheless there are some opinions voiced that seem a bit more extreme, such as the firm belief that Britain was entitled to use Ireland''s Atlantic ports and should have used force to obtain them, and the casual referral to the Labour Party as ‘socialists'' with the all the implications the word implies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the book gains much more than it loses from this perspective. Some of the anecdotes are very interesting indeed, such as the account of how he and Hitler almost met in person by chance in a German hotel shortly after the Führer''s seizure of power.</p>
 
<p>More than any other audiobook I have listened to, the narrator makes the book. Christian Rodska''s imitation of the style of Churchill''s distinctive speaking manner was spot on to my ears, and the accent was close too - more than once I forgot that it was not Churchill himself speaking.</p>
<p>I said when I started that if this was any good I would read the whole series, and that''s definitely the intention now. At the rate this was consumed, it should not take me long.</p>
<p id="time">Read - August 2014</p>
