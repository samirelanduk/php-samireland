Christmas

<p>I am in the middle of a sort of tour of the North. I spent the start of the week in Blackpool, seeing some old friends and generally enjoying being ''home'' (wherever that is), and am currently in Bacup, where I''ll be spending Christmas itself. I lived in Bacup for the first eleven years of my life, and even though I''ve barely been since then, it is sort of weird how familiar everything is. A bit like having a familiar dream.</p>

<p>I''ve done some under the hood changes to the website itself of late, making it easier to update, which I will use as my excuse for this particular long period without updating it.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas - here''s a picture of Bispham''s sea line this Christmas.</p>
