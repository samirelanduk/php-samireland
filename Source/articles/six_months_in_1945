<p>This is probably my favourite of all the history books I''ve read in the past year or so.</p><p>It was off to a good start even before I started the thing. The author, Michael Dobbs, is also th author of my favourite history book of all time: <i>One Minute to Midnight</i>. It also covers one of my favourite topics in history, which is the early cold war. I''ve always been interested in how the nuclear age started, and how the two superpowers came to regard each other as enemies.</p>
<p>So, it would have been difficult for this book to displease me anyway. But even if the above factors weren''t applicable, it is still very engagingly written. As in <i>One Minute to Midnight</i> Dobbs liberally sprinkles this account with Diction-esque dialogue and Biographical details of the middle-tier characters, to really take you into the story.</p>
<p>Easy to read, fascinating subject, highly recommended.</p>
