Preston

<p>Preston is the mightiest of all of England''s cities - unrivalled in economic power, and the pinacle of Western civilisation. I was there this weekend, so I know what I''m talking about.</p>
<p>It was a friend''s birthday party there, so I did the traditional thing and attended it. There were other people there too and, for one brief shining moment, an inflatable shark called Colin.</p>
<p>In other news, there are twelve days left until iGEM ends - officially anyway. Bit more than twelve days worth of work to go though...</p>
