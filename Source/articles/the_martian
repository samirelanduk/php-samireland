<p>My second fiction audiobook, <i>The Martian</i> was a sort of ‘assignment'' by a podcast I listen to regularly. And, as I had the ominous prospect of a nine hour overnight coach trip to London before me, I decided to give it a go. </p>
<p>I was extremely glad I did. <i>The Martian</i> was an excellent little story about a man trapped on Mars by his fellow astronauts, who believe him to have died during their aborted mission. The story is told largely through the mission logs of the eponymous Martian, Mark Watney – with occasional switches to the viewpoints of NASA and his former crew mates. </p>
<p>Its strength is very much in its ability to make you genuinely care about the fate of Mark Watney, as well as its ability to create genuine suspense as to how NASA (and Mark''s own ingenuity) will solve the problems that make Apollo 13 look like a minor space hiccough. </p>
<p>It should be noted that as I ‘read'' this as an audiobook, I avoided some seemingly fair criticisms that have been made of the book by others. Some have complained of the overly long technical descriptions of Mark''s problem solving, though this is less of an issue in an audiobook where you can more easily zone in and out as needed. Another criticism is the indistinguishability of some of the secondary characters, though again the audiobook meant this wasn''t a problem – the narrator (R. C. Bray) was excellent. </p>
<p>There''s a movie coming out soon, and I highly recommend you give the book a go first. </p>
