<p>This was a very readable run through of a handpicked selection of British foreign secretaries, from the Napoleonic wars to Anthony Eden. It is also therefore, an overview of British foreign policy during that eventful period.</p>
<p>Eventful, because it covers the rise and fall of Britain the Great Power. After engineering the defeat of Napoleon and securing for itself the pre-eminent place in the world, the book looks at how Britain chose to use this power, alternating between policies of liberal intervention and pragmatic realpolitik – a duality that continues to this day.</p>
<p>And inevitably, it deals with Britain''s relative decline. Its foray into the early twentieth century alliance systems and the catastrophe that resulted, its ineffectual attempts to control the rise of fascism, and its slow relegation to a mere principal ally of the United States. All of this is conveyed through the eyes of the men who were responsible for shepherding the UK through these events, over the years.</p>
<p>The book is well written, and strikes just the right balance between outlining the ‘back stories'' as it were of the men themselves, and detailing the events they handled during their time. I have never been especially drawn to histories which are essentially just biographies, but Hurd provides just enough detail to make you get a rough understanding of the men, before dealing with the meat of what you actually want to read about.</p>
