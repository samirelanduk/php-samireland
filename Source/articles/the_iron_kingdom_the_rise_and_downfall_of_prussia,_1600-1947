<p>I knew almost nothing about Prussia before I read this, except that it was vaguely related to Germany and that it wasn''t around any more. This was an excellent recap of the three centuries for which Prussia was a state.</p>
<p>Prussia started life as the electorate of Brandenburg and, from the 17th century onward, the Hohenzollern dynasty that ruled it pretty much expanded the power of their state through sheer force of will. Chunks of Sweden and Austria and Denmark and whole swathes of Poland were hacked off and amalgamated into the growing Prussian colossus which, in 1871, became the nucleus of the German Empire.</p>
<p>Clark makes the point again and again that Prussia, despite its reputation, had no unifying identity. Or at least, not one that its people would have identified with throughout its history. It was always a patchwork of never fully integrated statelets and territories bound together by the monarchy. In particular, he stresses that the Nazis'' attempt to co-opt what they saw as Prussian values was a blatant misreading of history, no matter what the victorious allies might have thought. He details the over-representation of Prussians in the various plots against Hitler, and tries to counter the long-held belief that Nazism was merely the latest expression of Prussian militarism:</p>
<blockquote>Many of the resisters clung to the idea of Prussia as a vanished better world whose traditions were being perverted by the taskmasters of the Third Reich. ‘True Prussiandom can never be separated from the concept of freedom,'' Henning von Tresckow told a family gathering when his two sons were confirmed at the Garrison Church in the spring of 1943. Uncoupled from the imperatives of ‘freedom'', ‘understanding'' and ‘compassion'', he warned, the Prussian ideals of self-discipline and the fulfilment of duty would degenerate into ‘spiritless soldiery and narrow bigotry''.</blockquote>
<p>The only somewhat dry sections were the chapters that left the unfolding narrative of Prussian history and looked at sections of the society in cross-section, such as the chapter devoted to religion in Prussia. Interesting, but not quite so easy to get through.</p>
<p>Anyway, now I know about Prussia.</p>
