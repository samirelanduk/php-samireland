Another Year

<p>Another New Year''s Eve has passed, and with it yet another reminded of our own mortality, and the doom that awaits us all. We are all another year closer to oblivion.</p>

<p>That aside, it was alright. I''m back in Edinburgh, and the Hogmanay fireworks were quite impressive - or at least they looked impressive from my window anyway. The cat did not agree.</p>

<p>Don''t want to get all retrospective, but it has to be said that 2015 was pretty great, as years go. Most of my worries of twelve months ago (namely that I would be jobless, homeless, and without any real purpose in life by the end of the year) were all dealt with and went away. 2016 looks set to be quite comfortable.</p>

<p>Happy New Year.</p>
