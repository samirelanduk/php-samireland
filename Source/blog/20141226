Christmas

<p>I survived the exams (in the sense that I''m alive anyway) and now I''m here in Blackpool.</p>
<p>Christmas has been pleasant enough - seen frends from home, and family, and I haven''t had to be woken up by an alarm in <em>days</em>.
<p>I have had to start work on the dissertation though, as unfortunately that won''t go away, and is in fact getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
