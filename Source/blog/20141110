Post-Boston

<p>It’s been a pretty eventful week or so.</p>
<p>The presentation, so long in the making, was given on Friday 31st. The room was more packed than I had predicted, but it actually went pretty well. There were no hitches, all four of us were pretty good, and even the questions went OK. All in all, we left that day feeling pretty happy with ourselves.</p>

<p>There were two more days of teams presenting after that, and Saturday and Sunday was largely spent listening to the other teams. Some of them were good, some of them were <em>really</em> good, and they were all interesting. It all went far too quickly though, and the closing ceremony on Monday soon came around.</p>
<p>We won a gold medal – technically our objective – so we were pretty pleased with that. Heidelberg won over all in the undergrad category, and Dundee did pretty well too. It’s all been a pretty amazing experience, and in fact I was able to write an actual blog post (as in for actual blog, not the sporadic things I post here) for PLoS Synthetic Biology’s website – <a href="http://synbio.plos.org/2014/11/03/pass-the-irn-bru-please-a-students-perspective-on-igem/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Boston itself was equally fantastic obviously. There wasn’t a huge amount of time for sightseeing but we got to see some stuff – just being in America itself was crazy.</p>
<p>Then it was time to come home. I left Boston on Tuesday evening, pretty gutted to be leaving, and arrived back at Edinburgh exhausted on Wednesday morning. I’ve pretty much spent the days since then pretending real life isn’t a thing and ignoring all the stuff that I have to do by the end of December.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a busy month. It was meant to be easier once iGEM was over, but I can’t quite remember why that was going to be so…</p>
