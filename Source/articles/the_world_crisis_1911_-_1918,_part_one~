<p>I decided to start this series after discovering they had the same narrator as Churchill''s over world war history, the account of his premiership during the Second World War. This set of books covers the First World War, and it is – more or less – equal in quality.</p>
<p>This book covered only the year 1914 (and the events leading up to it). It''s the familiar story of Europe slipping into war with absolutely no prescience of the self-inflicted disaster it was walking into, only with Churchill''s style and characteristic language. He might not have been a professional historian, but he knew how to tell a story.</p>
<p>As it is a personal account, a lack of bias should not be expected. There is plenty of mention of the ‘teutonic race'' and a far more harsh vilification of the Germans than had been found in the Second World War series. But, this aside, it is a good read (or ‘listen'' in my case).</p>
<p>If it has a weakness, it is probably an excessive focus on naval matters. Churchill''s role before the war, and for the first part of the war, was as civilian leader of the Royal Navy and consequently the book has endless details about the movement of particular ships, minute changes of staff, this and that naval engagement. The account of the battle of the Falkland Islands took me literally a month to get through, as I could not persuade myself to go back to the book to listen to more detailed descriptions of ships chasing each other around South America.</p>
<p>This should not detract from the book''s worth however and, while I am not going to read part two immediately, this is a series that looks very promising.</p>
