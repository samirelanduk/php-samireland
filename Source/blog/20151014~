Normality

<p>I\'ve been back in Edinburgh for a month now - moved into a new flat, and things are beginning to settle back down to normality.</p><p>Starting to think about what I want to do when my current project ends. I\'ve been looking at some PhDs down South that look really interesting, but PhD deadlines can take you by surprise so I need to start working on that. Otherwise I\'m just trying to bring any remotely useful skill I can up to date, so that I can spread my CVs as wide as possible when the time comes.</p><p>Short entry, but after the tumultous last few months, boring is good.</p>
