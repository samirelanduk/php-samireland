<p><em>The Last Battle</em> is an account of the fall of Berlin in the Spring of 1945, as the second world war in Europe was ending and the Third Reich was falling apart. It looks at the experiences of ordinary Berliners, the desperate attempts of the German army to form a defence (while being harangued by a then clearly insane Adolf Hitler), the rivalry of the Soviet commanders racing to take the capital, and the aborted Anglo-American attempt to get there first.</p>
<p>It''s not an exaggeration to say that almost every minute of the audiobook was genuinely interesting. I had supposed, before starting, that the narrative would largely document the experiences of people in Berlin and their suffering which - important to the story though it is - could have gotten a bit monotonous and heavy through sixteen hours of audio. The scope is wider than that however. There is much devoted to the Western allies, who for a long time wanted to get to Berlin before the Russians, and the story of how they slowly gave up on that ambition. The <em>what-if</em>s are interesting there, especially given the account of how an American crossing of the Elbe river that was narrowly repulsed almost allowed an American division to do just that, regardless of what the higher-ups intended.</p>
<p>Of course the narrative also examines the Russian commanders - Zhukov and Konev especially - but they get rather less space devoted to them than you might expect given that this is a book about the taking of Berlin, and they were the ones who... took Berlin. This is probably more a reflection on the time the book was written - American accounts were probably much easier to come by than Soviet ones in the 1960s - but it does make it much harder to identify with them. You root for the Americans and British tearing across the country from the West, you hope the Berliners you read about make it out alive, you even sympathise with the German generals tasked with defending the city - but the Soviet soldiers get too little coverage to feel anything about them much. Until the final chapter that is, when the accounts of the atrocities committed by those soldiers is presented.</p>
<p>There are many touching events recounted from the last days of Nazi Berlin, foremost among them is the story of the Zookeepers of the Berlin zoo who tried desperately to keep their beloved animals alive in a city under siege. Even Hitler is revelaed as thoroughly broken in his final days...</p>
<blockquote>Hitler could not bear to be alone. He kept walking up and down through the small rooms and talking with everybody who remained. He spoke of his imminent death, and the end that was coming.</blockquote>
<p>The book''s all-encompassing narrative stops short in only one area that it might have put more emphasis on - military casualties. Rarely if ever in the descriptions of the fierce battles does Ryan mention the deaths. Attacks are "repulsed" and advances can be "difficult" but actual deaths are not often mentioned.</p>
<p>In summary, this was a fantastic book, with excellent narration too by Simon Vance.</p>
