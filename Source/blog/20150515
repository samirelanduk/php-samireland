The End

<p>It''s over, it''s complete. After four years at Edinburgh, and after twenty years of being some sort of student or other, I have finished. The last exam is done and, as of yesterday, my dissertation is complete, bound, and submitted.</p>
<p>Now I have to decide what to do next. How I choose to spend the next six weeks will probably determine the course of my whole life to a worryingly large extent, so I will try to limit how much time I spend making unnecessary graphs in Python.</p>
<p>For today at least though, I intend to do nothing. Cheers Edinburgh.</p>
