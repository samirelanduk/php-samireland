<p>I first read a Terry Pratchett book ten years ago, in 2004. I think it was <i>The Colour of Magic</i> but I may be wrong. He has a pretty huge compendium (I love that word) of books, and it''s a testament to how enjoyable and thoroughly readable they are, that it was only three years before I''d read essentially all of them.</p>
<p>He''s a great author, is what I''m saying. Funny, yes. Wise even – satire at its best. <i>Small Gods</i> and <i>Night Watch</i> rank among my all time favourite books. He''s one of the few authors for whom the prospect of reading a collection of scattered articles and opinion pieces (a ‘compendium'' you might call them) from throughout their life is actually enticing.</p>
<p>For that''s what this book is. A collection of lots of different short pieces the man''s written over his life, mainly over his time as a writer, but some from before, when he was a journalist. They cover a wide range of topics – book signings, fan conventions, life as a local newspaper journalist. If the book stopped two thirds of the way through, it would be a mildly interesting but fairly forgettable insight into the mind of a great writer. But it doesn''t stop there, and the last third covers Pratchett''s writings on Alzheimer''s.</p>
<p>Pratchett was diagnosed with a form of early-onset Alzheimer''s in 2007, at the age of 59. There isn''t really a good age to get Alzheimer''s, but 59 is a particularly savage kick in the teeth.</p>
<p>The last third of the book is devoted to this.</p>
<p>He has written much on the topic – newspaper columns, speeches <i>etc.</i> He talks about his fury at the health service for essentially abandoning him due to his age, and the peculiarities of obtaining the necessary drugs. He talks about the fortune of having his communicative faculties undiminished, expressing a wish to write until he dies. And above all he talks about the ‘right to die'' movement, and his anger at the UK for refusing to allow the sort of assisted death available in Switzerland. This is a particular interest of his, expressed very movingly and convincingly in both this book and a documentary he made in 2011.</p>
<p>The whole thing is genuinely hard to read – devastatingly sad in fact. I don''t want Terry Practhett to go, and certainly not like this. He describes his wish to die in a manner of his own choosing...</p>
<blockquote>I intend, before the endgame looms, to die sitting in a chair in my own garden with a glass of brandy in my hand and Thomas Tallis on the iPod. Oh, and since this is England, I had better add “If wet, in the library”.</blockquote>
 
<p>...and, despite having no particular horse in the ongoing debate over assisted death, it''s hard not to wish him success.</p>
