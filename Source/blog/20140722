Trip Home

<p>Spent the weekend back home, in Blackpool. Didn''t do much while there, but it is always good to be home, and to see the sea again.</p>
<p>Some more work on the site is complete. It now has a <a href="\reading\">review section</a>, for the segment of the population who both know about this website, and are interested in what I think about stuff I''ve read - a large one I''m sure.</p>
