Longbottom

<p>Been a busy week. The nutri-whatever website version two is pretty much finished, and should be up for tomorrow. I''ve also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le_MJIc0ZHI">film for the iGEM project</a>, which was surprisingly time consuming but also quite satisfying.</p>
<p>There is now a cat in the flat. My flatmate (not the one who got lost up a mountain while asleep - the other one) has bought a sort of wee ragdoll beast, and it is pretty cute. He is called <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/11/neville-longbottom-is-the-most-important-person-in-harry-potter">Neville</a>, and he will hopefully do something to cull the mice when he is older. No offence mice.</p>
