<p>I know I said I wouldn''t read any more history for a while, but this is technically fiction, so I allowed it.</p>
<p><i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i> is the story of a young soldier''s perspective in the trenches of the First World War. Paul Bäumer is twenty years old, and like the rest of his classmates, was pressed into joining the German army as soon as they were old enough, by an older generation keen to stress the glory of war. </p>
<p>One by one, they are all killed.</p>
<p>The book spends a lot of time on Paul''s thoughts on the war and what it has taken from him. He is forever dwelling on how completely divorced from his old life he feels, how this is the only life he knows. His visits home are joyless affairs. And always he is brooding on the complete pointlessness of it all.</p>
<p>The most memorable scene is probably the twenty four hours or so he spends trapped in no-mans-land, with the soldier he has just killed with his bayonet.</p>
<blockquote> The silence spreads. I talk and must talk. So I speak to him and say to him: “Comrade, I did not want to kill you. If you jumped in here again, I would not do it, if you would be sensible too. But you were only an idea to me before, an abstraction that lived in my mind and called forth its appropriate response. It was that abstraction I stabbed. But now, for the first time, I see you are a man like me. I thought of your hand-grenades, of your bayonet, of your rifle; now I see your wife and your face and our fellowship. Forgive me, comrade. We always see it too late. Why do they never tell us that you are poor devils like us, that your mothers are just as anxious as ours, and that we have the same fear of death, and the same dying and the same agony. Forgive me, comrade; how could you be my enemy? If we threw away these rifles and this uniform you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert. Take twenty years of my life, comrade, and stand up—take more, for I do not know what I can even attempt to do with it now.”</blockquote>
<p>The book gets bleaker and bleaker as it works its way toward its depressing conclusion, as one by one his old classmates and friends are killed around him, until he hardly seems to care that Germany is losing the war. This is the book that the Nazi party burned when they came to power, for its defeatism and powerful anti-war message. A message that still makes it worth reading today.</p>
